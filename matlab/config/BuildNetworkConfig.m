function configOut = BuildNetworkConfig(maxMeasDelay, controlSequenceLength, maxControlSequenceDelay, ...
    caDelayProbs, scDelayProbs, config)
    % Function to create a config struct with network-related parameters as required by ncs_initialize.
    %
    % Parameters:
    %   >> maxMeasDelay (Nonnegative Integer)
    %      A nonnegative integer denoting the maximum number of time steps a measurement
    %      may experience before in order to be processed by the NCS components. 
    % 
    %   >> controlSequenceLength (Positive Integer)
    %      The sequence length to be employed by the sequence-based controller in order to cope with packet delays.
    %
    %   >> maxControlSequenceDelay (Nonnegative Integer)
    %      A nonnegative integer denoting the maximum number of time steps
    %      a control sequence may experience before in order to be processed by the NCS components.
    %       
    %   >> caDelayProbs (Nonnegative Vector)
    %      A vector with nonnegative entries summing up to 1 denoting the probability distribution
    %      of the delays in the CA-link (network between controller and
    %      actuator/plant).
    %
    %   >> scDelayProbs (Nonnegative Vector, optional)
    %      A vector with nonnegative entries summing up to 1 denoting the probability distribution
    %      of the delays in the SC-link (network between sensor and
    %      controller).
    %
    %   >> config (Struct, optional)
    %      A structure containing configuration parameters which shall be extended. 
    %      If this parameter is left out, a new structure with network-related parameters is created instead.
    %
    % Returns:
    %   >> configOut (Struct)
    %      A configuration struct, equipped with network-related
    %      parameters. If a config is passed as las input parameter, it is
    %      returned here.
