function config = CreateDoubleIntegratorScenario()
    % Function to create a config struct with parameters to define a
    % scenario where a double integrator plant (with unit mass), subject to a disturbance force, shall be driven to the origin
    % and where both measurements and control sequences are transmitted over networks. 
    % For simplicity, both networks have the same characteristics, i.e.,
    % they are described by the same delay probability distributions.
    %
    % Returns:
    %   >> config (Struct)
    %      A configuration struct, equipped with the specified
    %      parameters.
