function configOut = BuildControllerConfig(controllerClassName, Q, R, initialEstimate, filterClassName, config)
    % Function to create a config struct with parameters to define an
    % NcsController, i.e, a controller with quadratic cost function.
    %
    % Parameters:
    %   >> controllerClassName (Character Array)
    %      A character containg the name of the controller class (i.e., a subclass of SequenceBasedController) to be utilized. 
    %
    %   >> Q (Positive semi-definite matrix)
    %      The state weighting matrix in the controller's underlying cost function.
    %
    %   >> R (Positive definite matrix)
    %      The input weighting matrix in the controller's underlying cost function.
    %
    %   >> initialEstimate (Distribution, optional)
    %      A Distribution (e.g., a Gaussian or GaussianMixture) specifying
    %      the intial state of the controller or the filter associated with
    %      it.
    %      Leave out or pass the empty matrix, if not required.
    %      Should, however, be present, if filter is utilized.
    %
    %   >> filterClassName (Character Array, optional)
    %      A character containg the name of the filter class (i.e., a subclass of DelayedMeasurementsFilter) to be utilized. 
    %      Leave out or pass the empty matrix, in case none shall be
    %      utilized.
    %
    %   >> config (Struct, optional)
    %      A structure containing configuration parameters which shall be extended. 
    %      If this parameter is left out, a new structure with the specified parameters is created instead.
    %
    % Returns:
    %   >> configOut (Struct)
    %      A configuration struct, equipped with the specified
    %      parameters. If a config is passed as las input parameter, it is
    %      returned here.
